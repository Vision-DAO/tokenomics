* File System Model Analysis

** TODO Items Left [0/2]
*** TODO Asset Pricing (VIS)
*** TODO Disputes [0/2]
**** TODO Scenario 1: Unintentional

Perhaps due to network or hard drive failure. Chance dictated by a distribution in system parameters. Assume reliability increases over time

**** TODO .Scenario 2: on purpose

Due to empirical probability of j

Presented below are some analyses of the results of the initial run of the Vision file system simulation below:

      # How much space providers tend to start out with (in MiB)
      "provider_init_storage_dist": [[5, 5]],

  model = Model(
      initial_state=initial_state, state_update_blocks=state_update_blocks, params=params

  simulation = Simulation(model=model, timesteps=200, runs=1)
  result = simulation.run()

  df = pd.DataFrame(result)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: model_run
: None

And display the results of the simulation as an org table:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results value raw :noweb yes
<<model_run>>
from tabulate import tabulate

return tabulate(df.head(), headers=df.columns, tablefmt="orgtbl")
#+END_SRC

** Balance of the Treasury Over Time
Using the previous run of the model, we can visualize the change in the balance of the treasury over time, versus the number of users, and the total balance accumulated among them.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results file :noweb yes :tangle yes
<<model_run>>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df["treasury"] = df["providers"].apply(lambda x: x[0].balance)
df["providers_balance"] = df["providers"].apply(lambda providers: sum(prov.balance for prov in providers.values()))
df["users_balance"] = df["users"].apply(lambda users: sum(user.balance for user in users.values()))
df["n_users"] = df["users"].str.len()
df["n_providers"] = df["providers"].str.len()
df["n_unfilled_orders"] = df["orders"].str.len()
df["n_active_orders"] = df["active"].str.len()
df["total_capacity"] = df["providers"].apply(lambda providers: sum(prov.capacity for prov in providers.values()))
df["used_capacity"] = df["providers"].apply(lambda providers: sum(prov.used for prov in providers.values()))
fname = "output/all.png"
fig, axs = plt.subplots(4)

#df[["treasury", "n_users", "mkt_sprice", "n_providers", "n_unfilled_orders", "n_active_orders"]].plot()
